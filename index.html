         &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are millions of people all around the world who play volleyball. Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around the court too fast, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents. <br>

       Glance About Volleyball
    </h1></center></div>
    
    The sport originated in the <font size=5>United States</font>, and is now just achieving the type of popularity in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it <font size=5>ranks behind only soccer</font> among participation sports. 
    
    </br>
    Volleyball is a team sport played by <font size=5> two teams </font> on a playing court divided by a net. The object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court.<br>
     A team is allowed to hit the ball three times and rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.The team winning a rally scores a point.The best of three or best of five games will win matches.
